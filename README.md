# backend-projects-hub
This collection includes various personal and university projects I’ve worked on, using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and other technologies. As a Junior Software Engineer, I aim to build simple, functional applications that showcase my progress in web development.

## Projects Overview

The projects in this repository demonstrate my ability to:
- Build RESTful APIs with **Node.js** and **Express**
- Set up user authentication using **JWT** and **bcrypt**
- Connect to a **MongoDB** database
- Use **Express Handlebars** to render dynamic views
- Utilize **Nodemon** for faster development

I’m constantly improving my skills and updating my projects with new features and functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
